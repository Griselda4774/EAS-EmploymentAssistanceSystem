1) What criteria should be used in choosing an appropriate requirements engineering tool?
=>
- Requirements traceability mechanism
- Requirements analysis mechanism
- Security and accessibility mechanism
- Portability and backend compatibility
- Configuration management approach
- Communication and collaboration mechanism
- Change management support
- Online publishing support
- Usability features such as word processor compatibility
- SRS documentation format


2) Are there any drawbacks to using certain tools in requirements engineering activities?
=>
- Cost: Requirements engineering tools can be expensive, especially commercial tools. This can be a barrier for small organizations or projects with limited budgets.
- Complexity: Requirements engineering tools can be complex to learn and use. This can require a significant investment of time and resources for training and support.
- Lack of flexibility: Some requirements engineering tools are not very flexible and may not be able to meet the specific needs of a project. This can lead to frustration and inefficiency.
- Vendor lock-in: Once you have invested in a requirements engineering tool, it can be difficult to switch to another tool. This is because vendor lock-in can make it difficult and expensive to export your data from one tool and import it into another.
- Document-centric tools: Document-centric tools can be difficult to use for collaborative requirements engineering activities. This is because they can make it difficult to track changes and manage multiple versions of a requirements specification.
- Model-based tools: Model-based tools can be complex and difficult to learn and use. They can also be time-consuming to use for eliciting and analyzing requirements.
- Hybrid tools: Hybrid tools combine elements of document-centric and model-based tools. However, they can be more difficult to use and manage than either type of tool on its own.

3) When selecting an open-source tool, what characteristics should you look for?
=>
- License: Make sure the tool is licensed under a permissive open-source license.
- Features: Make sure the tool has the features I need.
- Community: Make sure the tool has a large and active community of users and developers.
- Maturity: Make sure the tool is mature and stable.
- Security: Make sure the tool is secure.


4) How can tools enable distributed, global requirements engineering activities? What are the drawbacks in this regard?
=>
Tools can enable distributed, global RE activities in a number of ways. For example, tools can be used to:
- Facilitate communication and collaboration: Tools such as video conferencing, chat, and instant messaging can help RE stakeholders to communicate and collaborate effectively, regardless of where they are located.
- Manage requirements: Requirements management tools can help RE stakeholders to track and manage requirements, even when they are working on different parts of the same system.
- Automate tasks: Some RE tasks, such as requirements elicitation and analysis, can be automated to some extent. This can free up RE stakeholders to focus on more complex tasks.

However, there are also some drawbacks to using tools for distributed, global RE activities. Some of the most common drawbacks include:
- Cost: RE tools can be expensive, especially commercial tools. This can be a barrier for small organizations or projects with limited budgets.
- Complexity: RE tools can be complex to learn and use. This can require a significant investment of time and resources for training and support.
- Cultural differences: Cultural differences can make it difficult for RE stakeholders from different cultures to communicate and collaborate effectively.
- Time zones: Time zone differences can make it difficult to schedule meetings and collaborate in real time.
